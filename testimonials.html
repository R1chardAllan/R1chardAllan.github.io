							<h4>Major Russell A. Hill, United States Marine Corps</h4>
							<blockquote>I had the privilege of working with and observing Richard Allan as he excelled in numerous Career Recruiter 
								billets for Recruiting Station (RS) Kansas City. As the Commanding Officer of RS Kansas City, I got to know Richard 
								as a Marine who is steadfast, enthusiastic, and reliable. He is a forward-thinking person, who thrives on and welcomes 
								new challenges, showing resilience in the face of hardship, and has a tremendous ability to solve unique problems. The 
								best examples of his leadership came in his ability to train the members of our team, using his robust technical 
								knowledge to build skill and confidence within each Marine around him. His initiative, outstanding leadership, effective 
								communication skills, and high moral character are a force multiplier to any organization.</blockquote>
							<h4>Blockquote</h4>
										
							<blockquote>Richard is an outstanding professional and dedicated leader of Marines who goes above and beyond to ensure mission 
								accomplishment. He is the epitome of a Staff Non-Commissioned Officer who is mature, inspires others to higher standards 
								and sets the example that others want to follow. He has performed flawlessly in a demanding billet that has had far reaching 
								impacts throughout the recruiting and manpower enterprise. Richard has been the cornerstone of the MCRISS team through his 
								keen ability to translate complex and intricate recruiting processes into the modernized digital software system for civilian 
								developers with no recruiting experience. He takes the initiative to look for areas where the MCRISS team and the vendor can 
								improve efficiencies and implement them to the benefit of increased effectiveness.

								He can be trusted to work autonomously, provide sage advice, and has the courage to speak up even when his view could be unpopular. 
								Richard has a rare ability to take the intent of any project or task and frame the most expeditious solution and then lead a team 
								to accomplish it without any supervision. He is highly cerebral and provides perceptions and imaginative viewpoints that lead to 
								resolutions of multifaceted and elaborate challenges that others struggle to deal with. He is a relentless worker who is passionate 
								about what he is doing.
