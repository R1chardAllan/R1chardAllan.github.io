										<h2 class="major">Leadership</h2>
										<p>My professional career has allowed me the responsibility of numerous positions of 
											leadership. I strengthened my leadership skills by completing three leadership courses. 
											These abilities I have developed have allowed me success in varied and challenging roles 
											as a leader. Early in my Marine Corps career, I supervised the maintenance of dozens of
											pieces of heavy machinery, valuing millions of dollars. I have been responsible for 
											the success of three enlisted recruiting substations and an officer selection station. 
											For a year, I assisted in the training and development a 54-person recruiting station. 
											Currently, I supervise multiple aspects of developing the new information support system 
											software for Marine Corps recruiting.</p>

										<h2 class="major">communication</h2>
										<p>	I have many hours of public speaking and interpersonal communication experience throughout 
											my many leadership and managerial positions. As a Career Recruiter, I have provided myriad 
											hours of training covering subjects such as sales, public speaking, business analysis, and 
											planning. On multiple occasions, I have been relied upon to facilitate last-minute public 
											speaking engagements with little preparation successfully. My experience has allowed me to 
											enhance my ability to communicate goals, plans, and changes throughout the hierarchy of my 
											organization. My interpersonal communication abilities have been impactful in discovering 
											ways to best employ team members in ways best suited for organizational success.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Problem Solving</h2>
										<p>Critical thought processes need terrific and creative analytical and communication skills. 
											The ability to ask thoughtful questions that garner the valuable information necessary to 
											analyze possible solutions to a problem is an essential and invaluable skill. I have been 
											in many situations that have required unconventional or "outside the box" solutions. From lost 
											shipments of goods needed for restaurant operations to personnel emergencies putting can't-miss 
											deadlines in jeopardy, I have been able to find successful solutions to various problems 
											throughout my career. I have also been able to employ other team members within their capabilities, 
											allowing them to capitalize on their strengths to enhance the problem-solving abilities of the entire team.</p>
